# remote-estimation-with-Bernoulli-erasure-channel
This repository contains MATLAB codes for remote estimation with two agents connected via a Bernoulli erasure channel. The codes for two models, Model A and Model B, are kept in two separate folders.

Model A: A symmetric Birth-Death Markov chain with countable state space; the birth rate is denoted by 'p'. From any state 'x', the transition probabilities to states 'x+1', 'x-1' and 'x' are 'p', 'p' and '1-2p' respectively. 

Model B: A first-order autoregressive process with zero-mean Gaussian innovations.
